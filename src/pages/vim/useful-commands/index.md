## Exiting Vi, Vim, Nvim, Gvim
1. Press escape to get you into "normal" mode
2. For exit type `:q` but if you made any changes in file Vim gives error code `E37` in this case:
- For save and exit, type `:wq`
- For ignore changes and exit, type `:q!`

**OR**
- Type ZZ (save and quit)

## Bare minimum functionality
Most likely you'll find yourself in "normal" mode, it allows you to enter commands by pressing the colon `:` key.
To get here from other modes you can type `ctrl + c` or `escape`.


To edit text and move around in a familiar way press `i`, for "insert" mode.
Try to move around with the arrow keys in "insert" mode.


Depending on the configuration, you may enter a file browser by typing and entering the command `:e .` in "normal" mode. The 'e' stands for edit, and the period for the file or directory.

## I Want to Learn Vim!
Start by pressing `escape` to check if you're in normal mode, press colon `:`, type `Tutor`, and press `enter`.
